            <p>Do you want overpriced coffee that is extremely acidic? You don't like acidic coffee, you poser?</p>
            <p>When you ask for a macchiato do you want the barista to say to you "Do you know what that REALLY is? Starbucks doesn't make real macchiatos"?</p>
            <p>How about do you want the barista to stare at you instead of asking you what can I get you?</p>
            <p>Then you've found your place!</p>
            <p>Come to Cafe Hipsta, located at your recently gentrified neighborhood of your trendy growing city!</p>
